# Checkpoint — 2026-02-11 (Session 3)

## Current State
All 8 user stories implemented. Prototype fully functional. Pushed to GitHub.
Dev server startup files added for convenience.

## What's Done
- Everything from Sessions 1-2 (all 8 user stories, 39 pages, build/lint clean)
- `start-dev.bat` — double-click to launch dev server + auto-open browser
- `HOW-TO-START.txt` — manual instructions, page URLs, prerequisites, troubleshooting
- GitHub repo up to date (George-Boole/metadata-repo)

## What's NOT Done Yet
- Tier 2B domain profiles are fictional placeholders — user to provide real ones
- Visual polish pass (user currently reviewing)
- US-005 comprehensive testing of all cross-tier links
- No automated tests

## Next Steps
1. User is actively reviewing the site — await feedback on visual polish / changes
2. Replace fictional domain profiles with real data when user provides it
3. Verify all cross-tier links work end-to-end
4. Optional: add automated tests, accessibility audit
