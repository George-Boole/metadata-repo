# Checkpoint — 2026-02-11 (Session 4)

## Current State
All 8 user stories implemented. Prototype fully functional. Tailwind CSS rendering fix applied. Pushed to GitHub.

## What's Done
- Everything from Sessions 1-3 (all 8 user stories, 39 pages, build/lint clean)
- `start-dev.bat` now clears `.next` cache on startup to prevent stale CSS issues
- Verified CSS loads correctly with all custom DAF theme variables

## What's NOT Done Yet
- Tier 2B domain profiles are fictional placeholders — user to provide real ones
- Visual polish pass (user reviewing)
- US-005 comprehensive testing of all cross-tier links
- No automated tests

## Next Steps
1. User is actively reviewing the site — await feedback on visual polish / changes
2. Replace fictional domain profiles with real data when user provides it
3. Verify all cross-tier links work end-to-end
4. Optional: add automated tests, accessibility audit
