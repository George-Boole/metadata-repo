# DAF Metadata Repository - Claude Code Context

## Project Identity
- **Name**: DAF Metadata Repository (Prototype/Demo)
- **Purpose**: Demonstration prototype for leadership discussions — showcases a centralized metadata standards repository for the Department of the Air Force
- **Repo**: Local Windows dev → GitHub
- **PRD**: `tasks/prd-metadata-repository.md`

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Data Layer**: Static JSON files in `src/data/` (no database, no external services)
- **Linting**: ESLint with next/core-web-vitals
- **Runtime**: Node.js, npm

## Key Architecture Decisions
- **No database** — all data is static JSON, loaded at build/render time
- **No real API** — the API Explorer page is a UI-only concept demo with mock request/response pairs
- **No external services** — runs entirely on localhost with zero dependencies beyond npm packages
- **Dual hosting model** — artifacts are either "Stored" (content in repo) or "Linked" (pointer to external authoritative source)
- **Read-only** — no CRUD operations, no forms, no state mutation

## Three-Tier Data Model
1. **Tier 1 — Authoritative Guidance**: DoD Instructions, memos, directives (DoDI 8320.02, 8320.07, 8310.01, 8330.01)
2. **Tier 2A — Technical Specs**: NIEM (with sub-specs), IC specs (IC-ISM, IC-EDH — mostly pointers), Dublin Core, W3C specs
3. **Tier 2B — Domain Profiles**: Organization-specific metadata profiles built from Tier 2A specs
4. **Tier 3 — Tagging/Labeling Tools**: Tools that apply metadata standards to data (DCAMPS-C, Purview, Varonis, Collibra). NOT metadata catalog tools.

## Current State
- **Phase**: All core features implemented. Ready for visual review and polish.
- **Last Completed**: All 8 user stories (US-001 through US-008) implemented via agent teaming. 39 pages, build clean, lint clean.
- **Next**: Visual review, cross-tier link verification (US-005), polish, and deployment prep

## Autonomy Rules
Claude operates at MAXIMUM autonomy **within this repository**:

### DO Freely (No Confirmation Needed)
- Create, edit, delete any files inside this repo
- Install npm packages
- Run `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, and any test commands
- Run any read-only commands (git status, git log, git diff, ls, etc.)
- Create git commits with descriptive messages
- Create and switch git branches
- Push to remote (after initial remote is set up)
- Modify mock data, components, pages, styles — anything in the codebase
- Add new directories and restructure the project as needed
- Use browser/playwright MCP tools to test the running app on localhost
- Use any MCP tools for research, documentation lookup, or code assistance

### ASK First
- Dropping/deleting the git repository itself
- Force-push or rewriting published git history
- Any actions that affect files OUTSIDE this repo directory
- Adding paid services or external API dependencies
- Major architectural changes that contradict the PRD (e.g., adding a database)

### ALWAYS
- Run `npm run build` before committing to verify the build passes
- Update `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` at end of session with what was accomplished
- Update the "Current State" section of this CLAUDE.md when phase/status changes
- Keep mock data realistic — use real standard names, document numbers, and organizations
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones where reasonable

### NEVER
- Commit .env files, secrets, or credentials
- Read, display, or echo contents of `.env` files in chat
- Execute commands or modify files outside this repository
- Install packages globally on the user's system
- Run destructive git commands (reset --hard, clean -f) without asking

## Coding Conventions
- **Components**: Functional React components with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS utility classes; no separate CSS modules unless necessary
- **File naming**: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components
- **Imports**: Use `@/*` alias for src-relative imports
- **Data access**: Import from `@/data/*.json` or utility functions in `@/lib/`
- **Types**: Centralize shared types in `@/types/`
- **Commit messages**: `type: description` (feat/fix/chore/test/docs/style)

## Agent Teaming (Planned)
This project is intended to use Claude Code agent teaming when available. The CLAUDE.md, SESSION_LOG.md, and task structure are designed to support multiple agents working on different features concurrently. When teaming is enabled:
- Agents should read CLAUDE.md and SESSION_LOG.md before starting work
- Agents should claim tasks via TaskCreate/TaskUpdate before working on them
- Agents should avoid conflicting file edits by working on separate features/pages

## Context Window Management

### Session Handoff Protocol
- **ALWAYS** update `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` at end of every session
- **ALWAYS** update `CLAUDE.md` Current State section if phase/status changed

### Mid-Session Checkpoint Protocol
When working on a long task (3+ chunks in one session), periodically write `docs/CHECKPOINT.md`:
```markdown
# Checkpoint - [timestamp]
## Currently Working On
[story ID and description]
## What's Done Since Session Start
[list of completed items]
## What's In Progress
[partially done work, what files are modified, what remains]
## Next Steps (if context resets)
[exactly what to do next to resume]
```
This file is ephemeral — overwrite it each time. It exists only to recover if a session is interrupted.

### Key Files to Read at Session Start
1. `CLAUDE.md` (this file) — project context + rules
2. `tasks/prd-metadata-repository.md` — full PRD with user stories
3. `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` — what happened in prior sessions
4. `docs/CHECKPOINT.md` (if exists) — interrupted work state
