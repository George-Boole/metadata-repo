I need to make a good description of product that I'd like to build that is essentially a mock-up/wire-frame/demo of a metadata repository. I just want it to have a good interface. The metadata repository would include three tiers of artifacts:

1. Being able to put in high-level requirements, like instructions and authoritative guidance from the DoD
2A. Having access to or containing many of the technical specs used for metadata like NIEM or the IC standards, such as IC-ISM
2B. Profiles for specific data domains that are built using the pieces from approved specs in 2A
3. Having a catalog of tools that can be used for metadata tagging and classification
